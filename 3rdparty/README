Building DOSBox dependencies
There are a number of dependency libraries required. 
- SDL 1.2 - https://github.com/blackberry/SDL
- SDL_sound - Follow the instructions in the SDL_sound subdirectory.
- TouchControlOverlay - https://github.com/blackberry/TouchControlOverlay
- libogg - https://github.com/blackberry/OggVorbis
- libvorbis - https://github.com/blackberry/OggVorbis

Notes: 
The OggVorbis repository is a little strange at the moment. You will have to
build it using the command line but also import it as a project (called vorbis).
